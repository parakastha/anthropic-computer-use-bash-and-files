Vue provides a convenient way to apply classes and inline styles dynamically using the `class` and `style` bindings. These bindings can accept various types of values, including objects, arrays, and computed properties, allowing for flexible and dynamic styling of components.

## Class Binding

### Object Syntax

The `class` binding can accept an object where the keys are class names, and the values are boolean expressions determining whether the class should be applied or not.

```html
<div :class="{ active: isActive }">Active</div>
```

In the above example, the `active` class will be applied to the `div` element if the `isActive` data property is truthy.

### Array Syntax

The `class` binding can also accept an array of class names. These classes will be applied to the element regardless of any condition.

```html
<div :class="['static', isActive ? 'active' : '']">Static and Active</div>
```

In the above example, the `static` class will always be applied, and the `active` class will be applied if the `isActive` data property is truthy.

## Style Binding

### Object Syntax

The `style` binding can accept an object where the keys are CSS property names (camelCased), and the values are the corresponding property values.

```html
<div :style="{ color: activeColor, fontSize: fontSize + 'px' }">Style Binding</div>
```

In the above example, the `color` and `fontSize` styles will be applied to the `div` element based on the values of the `activeColor` and `fontSize` data properties, respectively.

### Array Syntax

The `style` binding can also accept an array of style objects. These styles will be merged and applied to the element.

```html
<div :style="[baseStyles, overridingStyles]">Combining Styles</div>
```

```js
data() {
  return {
    baseStyles: {
      backgroundColor: '#000',
      color: '#fff'
    },
    overridingStyles: {
      color: '#8b0000',
      fontSize: '20px'
    }
  }
}
```

In the above example, the `baseStyles` and `overridingStyles` objects will be merged, and the resulting styles will be applied to the `div` element. If there are any conflicting properties, the styles from the last object in the array will take precedence.

These class and style bindings provide a powerful and flexible way to dynamically style Vue components based on data properties and computed values.
